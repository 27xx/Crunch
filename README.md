# Crunch

Crunch is a tool for PNG image file optimization on OS X.  It uses embedded versions of the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools.  Benchmarks with the current development version of Crunch are available [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md).

You can kick the tires with the current development version.  Download the dmg installer [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/releases/download/v0.9.0-dev-1/Crunch-Installer.dmg).

## Usage

Drag and drop your PNG images onto the Crunch window:

<img src="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/raw/master/img/crunch-ss.gif" alt="Crunch PNG image optimization usage">

Your optimized file is saved in the same directory as the original file with the modified path `[original filename]-crunch.png`.
