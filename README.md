# Crunch

Crunch is a tool for PNG image file optimization on OS X.  It uses a selectively lossy optimization approach with embedded versions of the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools.  This leads to a significant file size gain at the expense of longer file optimization processing times and relatively modest decrease in image quality (see example images below).

Mean percent of the original file size for CÃ©dric Louvrier's [PNG Test Corpus files](http://css-ig.net/images/png-test-corpus.zip) vs. other commonly used PNG optimization applications are:

| File                | Crunch        | ImageOptim       |  OptiPNG            |  PNGOUT       | PNGCrush    |
| :-----------------: | :------------:| :---------------:| :----------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| **Mean**            |  **50.64%**   |   **60.91%**     |  **69.28%**        |  **75.81%**    | **74.25%**  |


Full benchmarks with the current version of Crunch are available [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md).

You can kick the tires on the current development version.  Download the dmg installer [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/releases/download/v0.9.0-dev-2/Crunch-Installer.dmg), click it, and drag the Crunch icon to your Applications directory.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks (see the horizon line + clouds in the prarie photo) of the current iteration of this aggressive space saving strategy.  In many cases, PNG optimization with this approach will lead to excellent space savings and an imperceptible decrease in image quality.  In some cases, it does not.  Experiment with the image types that you use and please submit an issue report with examples of any images where the image quality falls short of your expectations for production ready files.  This will be helpful to improve our approach.

## Usage

Drag and drop your PNG images onto the Crunch window:

<img src="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/raw/master/img/crunch-ss.gif" alt="Crunch PNG image optimization usage" width="400">

Your optimized file is saved in the same directory as the original file with the modified path `[original filename]-crunch.png`.
