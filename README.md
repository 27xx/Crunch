## About

Crunch is a macOS tool for lossy PNG image file optimization.  It combines selective bit depth, color type, and color palette reduction with zopfli DEFLATE compression algorithm encoding using embedded versions of the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools.  This approach leads to a significant file size gain relative to lossless approaches at the expense of a relatively modest decrease in image quality (see [example images](#examples) below).

Historical benchmarks with the files included in Cédric Louvrier's [PNG Test Corpus](https://css-ig.net/png-tools-overview) versus (in some cases) previous versions of other commonly used PNG optimization software are available in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

## Install

Want to kick the tires?  Choose one of the methods below:

### 1. Install with Hombrew Cask Package Manager (Recommended)

```
$ brew cask install crunch
```

Note that you must use `brew cask install` and not `brew install`!


Following your install you can upgrade to the latest version with:

```
$ brew cask uninstall crunch && brew cask install crunch
```


### 2. Install with dmg Installer

**NOTE**: Active bug with pngquant library dependencies using this install approach - See [Issue Report #7](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/issues/7) before use.  Fix is in the works.

[Download the dmg installer](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/releases/download/v1.0.0/Crunch-Installer.dmg), click it, and drag the Crunch icon to your Applications directory.

Upgrade by following the same instructions and allowing the new version to replace the old version on your system.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the benefits and disadvantages of the current iteration of this aggressive space saving lossy optimization strategy.  In many cases, optimization with Crunch will lead to excellent space savings and an imperceptible decrease in image quality.  In some cases, it does not (see the horizon line + clouds in the prairie photo below) .  Experiment with the image types that you use and please submit an issue report with examples of any images where the image quality falls short of your expectations for production ready files.

## Usage

Drag and drop your PNG images onto the Crunch window:

<img src="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/raw/master/img/crunch-ss.gif" alt="Crunch PNG image optimization usage" width="400">

Your optimized file is saved in the same directory as the original file with the modified path `[original filename]-crunch.png`.
