## About

Crunch is a tool for PNG image file optimization on OS X.  It uses a selectively lossy optimization approach with embedded versions of the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools.  This leads to a significant file size gain at the expense of longer file optimization processing times and relatively modest decrease in image quality (see example images below).

Mean percent original file size for the 21 files included in CÃ©dric Louvrier's [PNG Test Corpus files](http://css-ig.net/images/png-test-corpus.zip) vs. other commonly used PNG optimization applications are:

|                     | Crunch        | ImageOptim       |  OptiPNG           |  PNGOUT        | PNGCrush    |
| :-----------------: | :------------:| :---------------:| :----------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| **Mean**            |    50.64%     |     60.91%       |    69.28%          |    75.81%      |   74.25%    |


Full benchmarks with the current version of Crunch are available [here](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md).

Initial impressions?

> Crunch is doing a remarkably better job than ImageOptim for PNGs. The same file was reduced to 189k with ImageOptim and 95k with Crunch. Just wow. :)

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the benefits and disadvantages of the current iteration of this aggressive space saving strategy.  In many cases, optimization with Crunch will lead to excellent space savings and an imperceptible decrease in image quality.  In some cases, it does not (see the horizon line + clouds in the prarie photo below) .  Experiment with the image types that you use and please submit an issue report with examples of any images where the image quality falls short of your expectations for production ready files.

## Usage

Drag and drop your PNG images onto the Crunch window:

<img src="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/raw/master/img/crunch-ss.gif" alt="Crunch PNG image optimization usage" width="400">

Your optimized file is saved in the same directory as the original file with the modified path `[original filename]-crunch.png`.
