# The `crunch` Command Line Executable

The `crunch` command line executable is a *nix executable that supports parallel PNG image optimization with local (off of the system PATH) installs of the pngquant and zopflipng project dependencies.  Compilation of pngquant and zopflipng from source is supported (and mandatory) as part of the installation process.  Please review the documentation below for details.

## Install

Clone the Crunch repository with the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch.git
```

Then install the `crunch` command line executable with one of the approaches below:

### 1. Install with `make` (Recommended)

```
$ make build-dependencies
$ make install-executable
```

sudo permissions are required to move the executable to your `/usr/bin/local` directory. Please enter your password when it is requested.

### 2. Install manually

```
$ src/install-dependencies.sh
$ sudo cp src/crunch.py /usr/local/bin/crunch
```

sudo permissions are required to move the executable to your `/usr/bin/local` directory. Please enter your password when it is requested.

Confirm your installation with the following command:

```
$ crunch --help
```

This command should display the in-application help message for the `crunch` executable.  If you see this text, you are all set to use `crunch`.

## Usage

Image processing is executed by requesting one or more PNG image paths as arguments to the `crunch` executable:

```
$ crunch [PNG image path 1]...[PNG image path n]
```

The executable works with shell wildcards.  For instance, to process all PNG image files in the working directory you can use the following:

```
$ crunch *.png
```

At the completion of processing of each of the requested images, the application reports the following data:

- percent of original image size
- optimized image file path
- final optimized image size in bytes

Optimized files are saved in the same directory as the original with the modified path `[original filename]-crunch.png`.

### Options

The following options are available for use with the `crunch` executable:

```
    --help, -h      application help
    --usage         application usage
    --version, -v   application version
```
