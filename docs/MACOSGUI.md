## Install

Choose one of the methods below:

### 1. Install with Hombrew Cask Package Manager (Recommended)

This approach requires a previous install of the Homebrew package manager on your macOS system. Please refer to the Homebrew documentation for details.

```
$ brew cask install crunch
```

Note that you must use `brew cask install` and not `brew install`!

Upgrade a previous install to the latest version with:

```
$ brew cask uninstall crunch && brew cask install crunch
```

### 2. Install with dmg Installer

[Download the dmg installer](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/releases/download/v1.1.0/Crunch-Installer.dmg), click it, and drag the Crunch icon to your Applications directory.

Upgrade by following the same instructions and allowing the new version to replace the old version on your system.

## Usage

Drag and drop your PNG images onto the Crunch window:
